# Nevergram Native
This is a React Native clone of a popular application Instagram. 

I've tried to mimic the appearance of the Instagram using React Native.

I am planning to use Firebase in order to make the application functional.

My PC would die using emulator so I was developing using react-native-web, therefore some style properties (styled-components/native) are not suited for native.
Need to fix that when I'll get a better device. Similarly with my mobile, it was taking ages to test an app using Expo application. ðŸ˜…

## Installation
The application uses [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)
>`yarn install`
## Run:
>`expo start`
